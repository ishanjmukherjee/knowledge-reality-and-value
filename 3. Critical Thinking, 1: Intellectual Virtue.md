# 3: Critical Thinking, 1: Intellectual Virtue
**What is rationality?** Huemer's answer: to hold "beliefs that are likely to be true, given the experiences and information available to you at the time."
***
**Why be rational**, ie, aim at having beliefs that are likely to be true?
* The selfish reason ("the truth is good for you"): 
	* "[i]f you want to become rich, then you need to have a host of correct beliefs about financial matters, such as how much that job you are considering pays, how much an apartment you are going to rent costs, what is the expected yield on a stock market investment, etc"
	* Ordinary mistakes due to irrationality may waste money and time. If you have incorrect philosophical beliefs, you could waste your *life*, eg by dedicating it to the pursuit of status or God that you only later realize was ill-advised.
* The moral reason: 
	* The position that it is *morally wrong* to have irrational beliefs is called **evidentialism**.
	* "[I]f one forms an irrational belief, and this has bad consequences, then one will be responsible for (one will be to blame for) those consequences. But if one has a fully rational belief, and it unluckily has bad consequences, one is not to blame for those consequences."
	* In other words, "[f]orming irrational beliefs makes you morally to blame if you act on those beliefs and there is a bad outcome; by contrast, forming rational beliefs insulates you from that kind of blame."
	* **The story of the unlucky samaritan**: fearing that a crashed car might catch fire, you rescue a driver from it who has a spinal injury that gets exacerbated due to moving her. It later turns that the car never did catch on fire. Are you to blame?
		* Yes, if you just wanted to experience being a good samaritan and had no good reason to suspect the car would catch fire. You had also been told  previously about spinal injuries and how one should avoid moving accident victims.
			* Even if the spinal injury didn't get exacerbated, you're still to blame because you took a large yet unnecessary risk of causing the driver harm.
		* No, if you had good reason to think the car would catch fire (eg, you saw gasoline moving towards the hot engine) and hadn't ever heard why one shouldn't move accident victims.
* "Irrational beliefs can also have an impact on your belief-forming methods, causing you to adopt less rational methods of forming beliefs in the future."
	* For example: "Suppose you accept, purely on blind faith, that there is a God. This might lead to your adopting the more general belief that blind faith is an acceptable way of forming beliefs. (If you don’t adopt that belief, it’s going to be hard to explain to yourself why your blind-faith belief in God is acceptable.)"
* Being irrational may be especially morally blameworthy in philosophy, since a person's philosophical beliefs are likely to have far-reaching implications on their actions.

On rationality and emotions: "A rational thinker is not a person with no emotional reactions. It is, however, a person who strives (reasonably effectively) to base his beliefs on objective evidence, rather than on his emotions. **Having feelings does not make you irrational. Believing that the world must be a certain way because of your feelings does.**"
***
**What is objectivity?** A facet of rationality: "a disposition to resist bias, and hence to base one’s beliefs on the objective facts."
* "The main failures of objectivity are cases where your beliefs are overly influenced by your personal interests, emotions, or desires, or by how the phenomenon in the world is related to you, as opposed to how the external world is independent of you."
* ***
**How to be more objective?**
* Identify your biases: "[i]f you are thinking about a controversial issue, and it makes you emotional, acknowledge the fact that your emotions could be clouding your judgment."
	* Excellent point: "It’s no defense to say, “But it’s appropriate to be emotional when babies are being murdered!” [in a debate on abortion] That’s just a completely different issue. It might well be appropriate, but that wouldn’t stop the emotions from clouding your judgment!"
* Diversify your information sources: learn the other side's best arguments and use academic, not popular media, sources.
* Challenge yourself: pass the [ideological Turing test](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html), ie, have the ability "to state opposing views as clearly and persuasively as their proponents."
